Shamsi: here are the instructions for the final test repository.

Shamsi: This app.py is used for python code for the web app.

Shamsi: This base.html is used for the template for the web app.


## Reflection and Instructions

### What I Learned:
This project helped me understand how to use GitHub for real project management. Here's what I did:

1. **Setting up**: I created the repository with my name in everything as required - the repo name, description, README, milestone, and issues.

2. **Planning**: I made a milestone with a deadline (Dec 17, 2025) to track my progress, like setting sprint goals in Agile.

3. **Breaking down work**: I created two issues - one for adding the Python file and one for the HTML template. I assigned them to myself and linked them to the milestone.

4. **Doing the work**: I uploaded my actual Recipe Finder project files (app.py and base.html) and updated the README each time.

5. **Local setup**: I cloned the repo to my computer using `git clone` to make sure everything worked locally.

### Instructions for using this repo:
1. Clone it: `git clone https://github.com/ShamsGafavor/Shamsi_final_test_p2.git`
2. Look at the files: app.py (Python code), base.html (HTML template), README.md (this file)
3. Check the Issues tab to see how I organized the work
4. Look at commit history to see my workflow

### Personal Takeaways:
- GitHub Issues are really useful for breaking down projects into manageable pieces
- Adding documentation as you go makes everything clearer
- The process of create issue → do work → update README → close issue feels organized
- Including my name everywhere was important for accountability
